1. I would characterize Audio Aura as energic, high rhythm but rather neutral. It may suggest more dance orienten music but it is only based on averages.
2. Based on energy, danceability and valency Audio Aura may be very good idea but, In my opinion, I may be improved by for example adding comparison of those values changes over time.
Then, some trends may occur for particular user. Additionally, taking genres or artists into consideration may also more personalize Audio Aura and propose even better suggestions.
